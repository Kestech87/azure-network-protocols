<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>
In this tutorial, we observe various network traffic to and from Azure Virtual Machines with Wireshark as well as experiment with Network Security Groups. <br />

<p>

In this tutorial, we delve into the world of network traffic analysis by employing Wireshark to observe diverse network activities involving Azure Virtual Machines. Additionally, we explore Network Security Groups, conducting experiments to enhance network security measures.

</p>

<h2>Actions and Observations</h2>

<p>

Step 1 (Create our Resources)

</p>

<p>
(Create our Resources)
  
1) Create a Resource Group

2) Create a Windows 10 Virtual Machine (VM)
    - While creating the VM, select the previously created Resource Group
    - While creating the VM, allow it to create a new Virtual Network (Vnet) and Subnet

3) Create a Linux (Ubuntu) VM
    - While create the VM, select the previously created Resource Group and Vnet

4) Observe Your Virtual Network within Network Watcher
</p>

<br />

<p>
Step 2 (Observe ICMP Traffic)
  
</p>

<p>
  
5) Use Remote Desktop to connect to your Windows 10 Virtual Machine

6) Within your Windows 10 Virtual Machine, Install Wireshark

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/oRuufh2.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
  
7) Open Wireshark and filter for ICMP traffic only

8) Retrieve the private IP address of the Ubuntu VM and attempt to ping it from within the Windows 10 VM
   
   - Observe ping requests and replies within WireShark

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4dKx5Uf.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
     
9) From The Windows 10 VM, open command line or PowerShell and attempt to ping a public website (such as www.google.com) and observe the traffic in WireShark

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TnWW8ds.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>

10) Initiate a perpetual/non-stop ping from your Windows 10 VM to your Ubuntu VM

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/LN1WQUN.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
   
  - Open the Network Security Group your Ubuntu VM is using and disable incoming (inbound) ICMP traffic

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qS6UnEy.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>

  - Back in the Windows 10 VM, observe the ICMP traffic in WireShark and the command line Ping activity

    - Re-enable ICMP traffic for the Network Security Group your Ubuntu VM is using

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/wGSsgnX.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>

  - Back in the Windows 10 VM, observe the ICMP traffic in WireShark and the command line Ping activity (should start working)

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8rNsIXx.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>

  - Stop the ping activity 
</p>

<br />
<p>

Step 3 (Observe SSH Traffic)

</p>
<p>
  


11) Back in Wireshark, filter for SSH traffic only

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/YqRZ8Nz.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>

12) From your Windows 10 VM, “SSH into” your Ubuntu Virtual Machine (via its private IP address)

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0CQbB5W.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
 
  - Type commands (username, pwd, etc) into the linux SSH connection and observe SSH traffic spam in WireShark

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9qSvP2I.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
 
  - Exit the SSH connection by typing ‘exit’ and pressing [Enter]
</p>


<p>





  
Step 4 (Observe DHCP Traffic)

13) Back in Wireshark, filter for DHCP traffic only

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Td6EPeE.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>

14) From your Windows 10 VM, attempt to issue your VM a new IP address from the command line (ipconfig /renew)

  - Observe the DHCP traffic appearing in WireShark

</p>




<p>
  
Step 5 (Observe DNS Traffic)

15) Back in Wireshark, filter for DNS traffic only

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/RoBh49h.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>

16) From your Windows 10 VM within a command line, use nslookup to see what google.com and disney.com’s IP addresses are

  - Observe the DNS traffic being show in WireShark
</p>




<p>
  
Step 6 (Observe RDP Traffic)

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ydfmJ0L.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>

17) Back in Wireshark, filter for RDP traffic only (tcp.port == 3389)

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/z480XYR.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>

18) Observe the immediate non-stop spam of traffic? Why do you think it’s non-stop spamming vs only showing traffic when you do an activity?

  - Answer: because the RDP (protocol) is constantly showing you a live stream from one computer to another, therefore traffic is always being transmitted
